# README

This is a simple Rails blog web application. Anonymous users can comment on blog articles, while only registered users can create new articles. User authentication is not handled by a gem like Devise, but a custom SessionsController. Thanks to Steve Polito for writing a great and comprehensive guide on [rails authentication from scratch](https://github.com/stevepolitodesign/rails-authentication-from-scratch).
